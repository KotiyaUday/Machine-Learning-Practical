We are using a dataset that includes information about customers, such as their age, experience, income, family size, education, and more. Based on these details, we aim to build a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to take a personal loan.\n\n\n\n**Importance:**\n\nThis problem is important for businesses, especially banks and financial institutions. Predicting whether a customer will take a loan helps them understand customer behavior better and make smarter decisions. For example, it can help reduce the risk of offering loans to customers who may not need them or are less likely to repay. It also helps in targeting the right customers for loan offers, improving the efficiency of marketing and loan approval processes.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019371,"end_time":"2024-10-22T18:36:53.909451","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-10-22T18:36:53.89008","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset Explanation\n\n****Overview:****\n\n\n\nThe dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including their demographic details and financial status.

ID: A unique number assigned to each customer to identify them.\n\n2. Age: The age of the customer.\n\n3. Experience: The number of years the customer has worked in their profession.\n\n4. Income: The customer’s annual income in thousands of dollars.\n\n5. ZIP Code: The postal code of the area where the customer lives.\n\n6. Family: The number of family members the customer has.\n\n7. CCAvg: The customer’s average monthly spending on credit cards.\n\n8. Education: The customer’s education level, which is coded as 1 (Undergraduate), 2 (Graduate), or 3 (Postgraduate).\n\n9. Mortgage: The amount of mortgage the customer has, if any.\n\n10.

Data Preprocessing:**\n\n\n\n* Handling Missing Values: We first checked for any missing values in the dataset using isnull().sum(). Luckily, there were no missing values, so no further imputation or removal of rows was needed.\n\n* Feature Scaling: Since the dataset contains numerical features like age, income, and mortgage, we scaled these features to bring them to a similar range. We used StandardScaler to normalize the data, which helps machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) perform better by ensuring that large values do not dominate smaller ones.\n\n* Encoding Categorical Data: The categorical feature \"Education\" was already represented as numerical values (1: Undergrad, 2: Graduate, 3: Postgrad), so no further encoding was needed.\n\n\n\n**2. Feature Selection:**\n\n\n\nWe selected the following features as predictors: Age, Family, Education, Securities Account, CD Account, Online, Credit Card, Income, CCAvg, Mortgage, and ZIP Code. We excluded the Experience feature to avoid redundancy with age. These features were chosen because they are likely to influence a customer's decision to accept a personal loan.\n\n\n\n**3. Modeling:**\n\n\n\n* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): We used the KNN algorithm to predict whether a customer would take a personal loan. KNN classifies based on the similarity of new data points to the closest existing data points. We set n_neighbors=3 and trained the model using the scaled training data.\n\n* Logistic Regression: We also applied Logistic Regression, which is a popular algorithm for binary classification problems. The logistic regression model was fitted on the scaled data, and we evaluated its performance in predicting loan acceptance.\n\n\n\n\n\n**The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to understand how well they performed on both the training and test data. Additionally, we plotted the distributions of key features (Income, Credit Card Average, and Mortgage) to explore the data visually.**","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.018176,"end_time":"2024-10-22T18:36:53.983684","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-10-22T18:36:53.965508","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 1: Library Imports","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.018615,"end_time":"2024-10-22T18:36:54.022419","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-10-22T18:36:54.003804","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **pandas as pd:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for loading and working with datasets in tabular form.\n\n* **numpy as np:** A fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.

This makes sense as people generally gain more experience over time.\n\n* **Income and CCAvg:** There's a moderate positive correlation between income and average credit card spending (0.65). This suggests that people with higher incomes tend to have higher average credit card spending.\n\n* **Mortgage and Personal Loan:** There's a moderate positive correlation (0.50) between having a mortgage and having a personal loan. This indicates that people who have a mortgage are more likely to also have a personal loan.\n\n\n\n**Moderate Negative Correlations:**\n\n\n\n* **Income and Education:** There is a moderate negative correlation (0.19) between income and education level. This could be due to factors like income discrepancies in different fields, the cost of higher education, or other complex socioeconomic factors.\n\n* **Family and CCAvg:** A moderate negative correlation (0.11) exists between family size and average credit card spending. This might suggest that larger families have less disposable income for credit card spending.\n\n\n\n**Weak Correlations:****\n\n\n\nThe majority of the correlations are weak, meaning there's little to no linear relationship between those variables. For example, there's a weak correlation between having a credit card and having a CD account (0.17). This doesn't necessarily mean they're unrelated, but rather that the relationship isn't a simple linear one.\n\n\n\n**Insights for Your Project:**\n\n\n\n* **Understanding Customer Profiles:** The correlations suggest that you might group customers based on factors like income, credit card spending, and mortgage status.
